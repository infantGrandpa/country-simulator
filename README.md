A little simulator of a group of cities that trade together. Heavily inspired by Sid Meier's Pirates!

This is just for funsies, so I have no idea how far this will go. The hope is to allow cities to trade together, then maybe build that out so cities can attack each other or raid trade routes. We'll see!
